# Student Management System - CLI Application

## Overview

This **Student Management System** is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application built using **Python**, **SQLAlchemy ORM**, and **SQLite**. The system is designed to help manage students, teachers, courses, and assignments, providing the functionality to add, update, view, and delete records. The system uses a relational database, allowing you to handle real-world educational data effectively.

## Features

- **Student Management**: Add, view, update, and delete student records.
- **Teacher Management**: Add, view, update, and delete teacher records.
- **Course Management**: Add, view, update, and delete course records.
- **Assignment Management**: Add, view, update, and delete assignment records.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary language used to implement the application.
- **SQLAlchemy**: An ORM library used to interact with the SQLite database.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight relational database used for storing data.
- **Pipenv**: A dependency management tool used to manage the projectâ€™s virtual environment.
- **VSCode**: A modern IDE used for project development and management.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-management-cli.git
cd student-management-cli
Step 2: Install dependencies using Pipenv
If you haven't installed pipenv yet, you can do so with:

bash
Copy code
pip install pipenv
Now install the project dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pipenv install
This will set up a virtual environment with all the necessary packages.

Step 3: Activate the virtual environment
bash
Copy code
pipenv shell
Step 4: Initialize the database
After setting up the environment, you can initialize the SQLite database by running the following commands:

bash
Copy code
python
>>> from databases.models import Base, engine
>>> Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
This will create the necessary tables for students, teachers, courses, and assignments.

Step 5: Run the application
To start the CLI application, run:

bash
Copy code
pipenv run python cli/main.py
This will open the main menu, allowing you to interact with the system.

models.py - SQLAlchemy Models
Defines the database models for Student, Teacher, Course, and Assignment using SQLAlchemy.

student_cli.py, teacher_cli.py, course_cli.py, assignment_cli.py - CLI Interfaces
These files contain functions for interacting with each entity's records via a terminal interface. Users can add, view, update, and delete records for students, teachers, courses, and assignments.

app.py - Main Entry Point
The entry point of the application. It handles the main menu and provides options to manage students, teachers, courses, and assignments.

Usage
Once the application is up and running, you can manage the data by following these steps:

Launch the app: Run the python app.py script to enter the application.

Manage Students:

Add a new student by entering the student's first name, last name, and email.
View the list of students, update their details, or delete them.
Manage Teachers:

Here is an example of how to add a student and view all students:

bash
Copy code
$ python cli/main.py
